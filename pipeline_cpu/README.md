# 32-bit 5-Staged Pipeline MIPS CPU
## Introduction
* Overview : Use Verilog and Design Compiler to design a simple 5-staged pipeline 32-bit Single-Cycle MIPS CPU from RTL to Synthesis
  * Same supported functions & test data as the single-cycle CPU project
  * Solving data hazard & control hazard

* Block diagram
